# FieldTechBossAlert

As a field technician, we have strict protocols to follow. As myself and co-workers and all field techs get comfortable, we might get lax with
some of these protocols. The managers are around to enforce these rules and protocols. Sometimes these things can lead to discipline. I take safety
seriously, however, I do not want my fellow co-workers and field techs to get into trouble. So boss tracker is my hopefully simple to use solution
to inform your field tech friends about a boss on the prowl.
